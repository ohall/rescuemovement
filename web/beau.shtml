	   <p>This is Beaulero, a 16.2 Dutch Warmblood gelding with wins in the 1.10 to 1.15 in top shows such as Brownland and Ocala. A dead safe, in your pocket beautiful boy that yes, was going to slaughter for a reason as simple as not wanting to take the time to sell him. As an equine lover and an active rider in the A circuits, a horse like this is something we all drool over whether for ourselves, or a client, or just admire at shows when watching him take care of a young junior in the ring, and we found that horse ready to be slaughtered for human consumption. </p>

<p>The minute Beau was taken home he was perfect. A beautiful confirmation, perfectly sound, walk/trot/canter on a loose reign with a beautiful counter-canter, lead change, even flowing strides that could win a flat class, and a perfect halt with a small touch of your reigns. If that doesn't have you wishing to come ride him, the over fences attitude of this horse will make you even more anxious. He was a sit and steer over every fence we threw at him. Roll top? Not scary. Brick wall? Not even close. A wind-blowing cooler on an oxer? Please. Liver pool? Way too easy for Beau. With his huge consistent stride he got down the lines easy. No matter what scary distance we would ask of this horse, he would take it with the most forgiving attitude; even a chip to a 4'3ft vertical and he was happy to keep going in his happy mouth bit. </p>

<p>These are the caliber of horses that you can find at Rescue Movement. As I have since learned: the thought of a horse this talented suffering a cruel fate without a thank you from his now Grand Prix level rider is hard to swallow. Every horse deserves kindness and to never see the face of these terrible slaugher auctions, as their final fate.  Remembering the pony and horses that took care of me and made me the rider I am today, was more than enough thought to spread awareness and hope and fight to see more horses under this situation in our show world.</p>
