              Meaghan Fleischer rides for Rescue Movement. Now 21, and riding since age five, Meaghan’s true passion and compassion for equine second chances,
              is why she is behind this charity. Rescue Movement is a division of National Equine Rescue Foundation Inc., a certified 501(c)(3) nonprofit
              creating a presence in the Equine Show world.</p>


          <p><b>FACT:  MOST HORSES WHO GO TO SLAUGHTER ARE IN GOOD CONDITION. </b> Each year more than 170,000 American horses are slaughtered for human consumption.
              USDA statistics show that over 92% of horses slaughtered are in good condition and able to live productive lives. Many horses are sold for slaughter
              merely because their owners can no longer afford them and aren't willing or able to find a good home for them or donate them to a rescue group.</p>

          <p>Having the best intentions in the world does not buy feed, pay the vet, or secure a stable to call home. Rescue Movement plans to be self-sufficient
              through our Ambassador Program, Sponsors, and Donors who generously see the merit of the charity and the humanitarian resonance of Meaghan’s efforts.
              This year, being in Wellington, FL., January and February has and will be helpful in creating a presence and getting the word out! Secret (show name Secret Service)
              the rescue pony that is winning everyone’s heart is in Wellington as well!</p>

          <p>After all, a second chance is what we all want when you come right down to it! Giving horses and ponies that second chance is what
              Rescue Movement is all about. Enter here and often!</p>
