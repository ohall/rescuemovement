        <h1>About Rescue Movement</h1>
<p>Rescue Movement is a division of National Equine Rescue Foundation Inc., a certified 501(c)(3) nonprofit creating a presence in the Equine Show world.  Our organization was inspired by our self-sponsored rescue of two horses and one pony from a kill shelter. To date, we have rehabilitated and sold one of the horses, which is now back in the show ring. The other horse was with foal at the time of her rescue and is due this summer.  The pony is being trained for show competition and is also used to train young riders.  

<p>Our co-founder, Meaghan Fleischer has been riding since age 5 and was emotionally impacted by witnessing her first pony being abused by the present owner and not having the financial means to buy her back.  Meaghan, an active rider in the A circuits, has since dedicated herself to rescue and rehabilitation and is passionate about making a difference in the show ring and life. 

<p>We are positioning ourselves as a viable partner to the equine community working toward social change.  Building friendships is an integral part of our mission. We are recruiting Rider Ambassadors to raise awareness for our initiatives: Rescuing, rehabilitating and training unwanted horses and ponies to be successful competitors; and making connections between our rescue animals and new riders.  Our Ambassadors are proud to Ride for Rescue Movement and wear our colors: black, white and gold. 

<p><a href="friends.shtml">Be a Sponsor</a> -- Donate to the rescue and rehabilitation of horses and ponies who are facing slaughter. Our first goal is to purchase a barn with an indoor and outdoor ring and at least 8-10 stalls to support our rescue operation.
