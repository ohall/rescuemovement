        <h1>Meet Secret</h1><blockquote>If we are defined by our secrets, and not by the face we show the world--then the pony was the secret that raised me above the surface of life and allowed me to define who I am...</blockquote>

<p><img src="images/Secret.jpg" alt="" align="right"><b>Meet Secret</b> - the pony who had "secretly" started it all! We found her in the third lot of the kill pen, seeming as if she was hopeless, cranky, and burnt out more than the other equines that were too dealt a bad, careless hand around her awaiting a cruel and short lived journey. We were shocked to see such a beautiful pony at such a place, but sadly it is a regular occurrence. On our initial approach, she pinned her ears and sat dully with her head down, her mane hay-covered and falling apart due to the fungus that had spread from her half shaved forelock. She had appeared to be extremely sore, especially on her back. She would kick out in pain the minute pressure was applied to her spine, and lunge towards us with her teeth, ears still pinned from the first moment we saw her. Sometimes she would see another horse leave, and her ears would poke up and her small eyes would widen with love and curiosity, almost as if she thought she had hope of leaving with them, too. I've never seen a horse express such emotion, and sadly you can tell that she has just given up. That night we bid on her at the auction we had found her at, and took her home the next day as our own to love, and to help restore her undying spirit that all horses have.

<p>The difference between Secret is like night and day. When we first took her home, it was a struggle; she would bite, kick, and lunge whenever approached. I often came home with a new large bruise to come back again the next day with a new one. Luckily, riding wise her breeding of some sort of welsh cross was inevitable. She showed so much eagerness to learn and spice that you love to see in a pony, especially one that was so hopeless seeming. She had amazing gaits and a +10 jump that would beat any expensive show pony in the ring.  I would slowly notice after our work together and after a good school, she would perk up and start reaching out more, she just wanted to not be hurt again. That small difference to see and feel is something that will make the greatest of problems melt away, and soon you find yourself addicted to making her happiness your biggest priority; and I believe Secret felt the same. 

<p>Our little "Secret Service" is now the first one at the gate, the one who we rely on when a young child wants to ride and smush over a pony safely, the one who won't leave you alone until she is given attention, the one who taught me patience and understanding, and the one who inspired us to do it again, and change more lives for more horses who should never have to suffer due to human fault.
